# AI â€“ Sentiment Analysis with NLTK
This is a beginner sentiment analysis project using Python and NLTK. It classifies Amazon product reviews as positive (1) or not (0) using the VADER sentiment analyzer, a pre-trained Natural Language Processing model. Based on a [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/text-analytics-beginners-nltk?utm_source=chatgpt.com) tutorial, this project helped me understand the basics of text mining and Natural Language Processing.

# What I learned

* Basics of Natural Language Processing and AI applications.
* How to use a pre-trained AI (VADER from NLTK) to analyze sentiment.
* How to classify text using polarity scores.
* How to evaluate model accuracy using sklearn metrics.
